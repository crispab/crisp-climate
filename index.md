# Our Mission: Reduce Global Warming

Global warming is the biggest challenge in the world!
The main cause of global warming is CO<sub>2</sub> emission.
Therefore, if we find ways to reduce global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, we can make the world a better place!

# What is the Climate Crisplet?

We are a community dedicated to reducing global warming, mainly by finding ways to reduce global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

Some of us work full time on this, while most work part-time. It’s really up to each individual.

We started this community because we noticed that a lot of very smart, passionate people are worried about global warming and want to do something about it, but aren’t sure where to start. So we hope this community will be an informal gathering spot, a center of gravity where we inspire and inform each other, and learn together how to contribute effectively.

## What’s a “Crisplet” anyway?

[Crisp](https://www.crisp.se){:target="_blank"} is a Swedish consulting company. Crisplet is just the term we use for an internal community of interest. Although in this case it is an open community.

So think of Crisp as the host of the community. See [dna.crisp.se](https://dna.crips.se){:target="_blank"} for more info about this interesting and rather odd company :o)

# What does it mean to be a member?

Climate Crisplet is an open and inclusive community. Feel free to join if you share our mission and are willing to invest some time and/or money on it. You choose when & how to contribute.

We’re definitely not alone, so we’re happy to support and collaborate with other organizations that share the same mission.

# How are you reducing global warming?

We’re just getting started, but we [blog about it here](http://blog.crisp.se/tag/climate). We aim to pull whatever levers we can - technology, policy, law, market forces, research, education, lobbying, etc.

# How do you work in practice?

Currently we have an active slack and regular (both face to face and online).

# What are your guiding principles?

* Pragmatic > Fundamentalist
* Inclusive/Open > Exclusive/Secret
* Action > Blame/Shame/Denial
* Inspire > Push  
  We don’t try to force agendas on each other, or force ourselves to agree on a single approach. Instead we share knowledge and inspire everyone to act on own initiative.
* All solutions are right  
  We don’t know in advance which solutions are best. So whether or not I believe in your solution, I will applaud you for trying it out.
* Data > Opinion.  
  We try to quantify our efforts, and base our learnings and conclusions on real data.
* Long term > Short term  
  Global warming is a long term problem, so we are looking for long term solutions
* Global > Local  
  1 ton of CO<sub>2</sub> = 1 ton of CO<sub>2</sub> regardless of location
* Respect  
  We treat everyone with respect, even those who don’t agree with what we’re doing or how we’re doing it.
* No political affiliation  
  We’ll support anyone who shares our mission.
